# A Comprehensive Analysis for Learning with Data & Label Noise
This project explores the impact of different types of noise on learning algorithms, focusing on input noise in Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithms and label noise in multiclass classification problems. The study is divided into two parts:

1. Robustness of NMF algorithms against large amount of data noise (Pepper & Salt Noise, Block Noise)
2. Design of Classifiers for Class-Conditional Label Noise (CCN)

The goal is to analyze and improve the robustness of algorithms when subjected to noisy data or incorrect labels.
